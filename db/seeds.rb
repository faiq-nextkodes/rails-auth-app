# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# Brand.create([
#   { brand_name: "ASUS" },
#   { brand_name: "Adidas"},
#   { brand_name: "Nvidia" }
# ])

# Product.create([
#   { name: "Monitor", price: 70000, brand_id: 1 },
#   { name: "RTX 5090", price: 450000, brand_id: 3 },
#   { name: "Wallet", price: 1200, brand_id: 2 },
#   { name: "GTX 1080 ti", price: 450000, brand_id: 3 }
# ])

# User.create([
#   {email: "test@example.com", password: "test123"}
# ])
